# Scray Maven Archetype

This archetype supports writing Scray compatible jobs by hand by creating:
- directory structure
- pom.xml that creates an ueberjar for the job
- bin directory with shell script to start the jobs
- minimal job structure

## Usage:

### Building

To use the archetype artefacts they must either be pulled from a archetype-repo or installed in the local repo.

    mvn clean install

### Create project from archetype with maven
Archetypes are enhancements of maven ("plugins") that can generate new projects. To use them classical maven coordinates must be provided.

    mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=scray -DarchetypeArtifactId=scray-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT -Dhdfs-uri=hdfs://127.0.0.1:8020 -Dyarn-resourcemanager=127.0.0.1

### Running the jobs:

The options <code>--master</code> with the Spark master URL and <code>--total-executor-cores</code> providing the number of cores are required by the runner script.

    bin/submit-job.sh --master <URL> --total-executor-cores <NUMBER> <program arguments specified in the job>

For the url of the master there are several options:
- <code>spark://&lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;</code> (default port 7077)
- <code>yarn-client</code> (run a job with a local client but execute on a Hadoop yarn cluster of spark workers)
- <code>yarn-cluster</code> (run the client and the workers of the Spark job on a Hadoop yarn cluster)
